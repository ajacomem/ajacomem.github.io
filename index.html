          Angel Jacome is currently a second-year master’s student in City Planning at MIT. 
          A life-long bus rider, Angel grew up in Chicago and has witnessed the importance of 
          well-functioning public transit in the lives of those reliant on its service. 
          Previously, Angel worked as a high school social studies teacher in Brooklyn, NY, 
          where the stories of his students’ challenges with public transit inspired him to enter the field. 
          He currently interns at Nelson/Nygaard, a transportation consultancy firm. 
          In his free time, Angel follows the Cubs with a healthy pessimism and enjoys
        cooking and watching movies.</p>
